Net::SMS::12Move
================

Description
-----------

This package contains a class sending SMS's via the free SMS service of
www.12move.nl. It supports multiple user accounts. It can also maintain a
persistent state hash in which the state of the user accounts is saved so
that login's aren't always necessary etc. Unfortunately this web based
service takes a few minutes to send an SMS, but a least it works (for now).
